# Project: Lab 26 - Component Based UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Author: Tricia Sawyer

## Project domain

- SASS - Nesting and Variables
- "Component Architecture"
- Application and Component "State"
- Debate/Discuss Libraries vs Frameworks
- Basics of a React App
  - index.html in public (root div)
  - index.js as an untouchable "bootstrap" or "entry point"
  - React Renders into that div
  - JSX is actually javascript but it looks like markup
  - Components can be classes or functions. What gets "returned" gets "rendered"
    - Class - `render() { return(jsx) }`
    - Function - `return(jsx)`
  - Components can load and render each other
  - Components can load their own css
